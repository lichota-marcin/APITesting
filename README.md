# API testing

This project contains tests of 4 calls (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) made to Trelo API using different tools.

In APICalls package I've made calls using ApacheHTTPClient and Retrofit.

In main directory I've created JacksonModels Package used by Jackson, same for RetrofitModels package.

In utility directory there is property manager that uses Property class to handle sensitive data. 

In AssertJTests, TestNGTests, RestAssuredTests and RetrofitTests packages I've put simple API tests.
