# API testing 

This project contains tests of 4 calls made to Trelo API using different tools

In APICalls package I've made calls using ApacheHTTPClient (aside from RetrofitCall class).

In main directory I've created JacksonModels Package used by Jackson to parse responses to classes (Pojo generation tool created a long class with four different subclasses, I wasn't sure what to do with it, so I did some stuff, and it works, but I would appreciate advice how should I handle those autogenerated pojo classes)

In utility directory there is property manager that uses Property class to handle sensitive data. Using property file forced me to add exception handling everywhere and, I'm sure there is a better way to do it, so some directions regarding property handling would also be appreciated.

In AssertJTests, TestNGTests, and RestAssuredTests packages I've put simple API tests (I am sure there is a better way to structure these files but couldn't think of any)

RestAssuredTests package contains failed attempt to make call to Trelo API. To check if there is a problem with API response I made call to some other API in SimpleRetforitForChecking package and it works, so I think that Trelo API response is somewhat faulty, or I made some mistake I can't find (more on that in comments in RetrofitCall class in API calls package)
